It is common knowledge that a strategy application is indispensable for the smooth operation of our department and the entire team. The knowledge gained is invaluable, and
thus it is of incredible importance to find a solution before the next season. Though the task is daunting, there may be a solution that is easier to implement and more practical.
	In the strategy application, three fundamental qualities judge whether it is useful or not. Those are;
 I. Ease of Use
 II. Inherently comparable
 III. Accurate
It is in that order that our focus should be, and here is why. If an application is challenging to use, which both Doug’s and the paper scouting materials were,
human error can and will affect results to the point where results are not reflective of real data. Thus, the secondary and tertiary functions are useless. 
If we leave the accuracy for an algorithm to decide, the result is a much better application. With the (incredibly) preliminary idea, I believe all three may be attainable.
The biggest weakness of Doug’s application merely the lack of adequate data produced. Of course, one could determine the robot that scored or played defense most;
however, the data does not necessarily measure the robot’s efficacy in general. For example, the robot who scored the most during the event could have done so at the expense 
of climbing, or the robot that played defense the most may overuse the tactic. With the following system, each robot can be compared with another efficiently and effectively 
by a score.
	The system I propose is derived from Elo's equation used in chess, video games, and other competitive sports to determine someone’s skill.
probability of robot a winning = 1/(1 + 10 ^ ((Rb-Ra) / 400) )
probability of robot b winning = 1/(1 + 10 ^ ((Ra-Rb) / 400) )
New rating = rating + 16(score - expected score)
	Though FIRST robotics games have always been team-oriented, robots could be compared under three categories; Offense (primary means of acquiring score, I.E., shooting 
power cells.) Defense, (preventing the opposite team from scoring) and Utility. (secondary means of acquiring score, I.E., spinning or hanging.) All robots will begin with a 
3600 as an average robot unless pit scouting proves otherwise. (0s may be given to robots missing a shooting or hanging functionality.) their rating will increase or decrease
based upon the application, in which there is a concept below.
